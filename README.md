# SeturAssessment

Hi there!
A simple phone book application was made by designing a structure that communicates with at least two microservices.

 - *Contact Microservice*
	 - Add contact
	 - Remove contact
	 - Add contact information
	 - Remove contact information
	 - Get contact with contact information
 - Report Microservice
	 - Create location based statistics report 
	 - Check report status
	 - Get report details
	 - Get all report list

	  

# Usage

In order to use the application, it must be **run on 2 microservices.** When the applications run, the swagger page will welcome you. You can run your tests with APIs via **Swagger.**

Fake records are available in the database.

## Using Technologies

 - .Net 6 
 - MongoDB Cloud
 - RabbitMq Cloud
 - Git/Github

## Dependencies
.Net 6 SDK

> **Mongodb and RabbitMq run on the cloud. So you don't need to do anything to run the application.**
